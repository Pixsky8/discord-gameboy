A Discord gameboy bot to play with friends on Discord.
You should create a dedicated channel to avoid flooding discussion channels since the bot uploads a lot of images.

You will need to install docker.
If you are on linux run install.sh the first time then start.sh afterwards.


TODO:
    - Queue for inputs
    - Multiple channels can play at once
